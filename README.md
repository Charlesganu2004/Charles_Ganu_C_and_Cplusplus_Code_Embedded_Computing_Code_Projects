# Lab 0: Calculator UI with Persistent LCD Output
## Description
This project implements a simple UI for a calculator that accepts numerical inputs from a keypad and displays them on an LCD screen.

## Functionality
- Uses an LCD screen to prompt the user for input.
- Accepts velocity and pressure values through a keypad.
- Displays the entered values on the LCD screen.
- Implements input validation to prevent erroneous entries.

## Achievements
- Established basic LCD interfacing with the MyRIO.
- Implemented error-checking mechanisms for keypad inputs.
- Ensured persistent display of results on the LCD screen.

# Lab 1: High-Level UI with Persistent LCD Output
## Description
This project builds upon Lab 0 by implementing a structured user interface for enhanced interaction and data handling.

## Functionality
- Displays prompts and accepts multiple user inputs via a keypad.
- Allows the user to enter velocity and pressure values.
- Implements robust input validation techniques.
- Uses formatted LCD output for a clearer display.

## Achievements
- Improved the UI by making prompts more interactive.
- Strengthened input validation to handle various erroneous inputs.
- Ensured smoother transitions between input and output displays.

# Lab 2: Mid-Level UI with Persistent LCD Output
## Description
This project refines the keypad input handling mechanism by improving how characters are processed and displayed.

## Functionality
- Accepts two numerical inputs via the keypad.
- Handles backspace (DEL) and Enter (ENT) key functionalities.
- Prevents multiple decimal points in a single entry.
- Restricts the placement of negative signs.
- Displays user-entered values on the LCD screen persistently.

## Achievements
- Implemented a more robust user input mechanism.
- Developed a buffer system for managing input characters.
- Improved real-time validation by checking for misplaced symbols.
- Allowed for seamless data entry and error correction.

# Conclusion
These labs successfully demonstrate the integration of MyRIO with an LCD and keypad to build an interactive user interface. The projects progressively refine user input handling, display mechanisms, and error validation, creating a solid foundation for future enhancements in embedded UI development.
